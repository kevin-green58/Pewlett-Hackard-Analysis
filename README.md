# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to synthesize the multiple data sets available at Hewlett-Packard into a managable size. The data sets contain information on current employees, their position, time spent at the company, etc. Getting the necessary information together will help high level employees make business decisions on how to handle the inevitable wave of retiring employees.

## Results 
- There are 90,398 employees at Hewlett-Packard born between 1952 and 1955, they are likely to retire.
- Of the the 90,398 mentioned 40,378 have held multiple positions at Hewlett-Packard during their respective tenures.
- Of the 90,398 mentioned, 29,414 are Senior Engineers, 28,254 are Senior Staff, 14,222 are Engineers, 12,243 are Staff, 4,502 are Technique Leaders, 1,761 are Assistant Engineers, and 2 are Manargers.
- 1,940 employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Summary
There are 90,398 employees who are of retirement age at Hewlett-Packard. The HR division should be prepared to fill this many roles over the next few years. Though it is entirely possible that some of these roles could be consolidated into one, which would decrease the total amount of people needing to be hired. There are 1,940 employees that are eligible to participate in the mentorship program, which means that only around 2% of the outgoing employees would need to act as mentors to make the program a success. One would want to do cost-benefit analysis to see if would be profitable in the long run to offer an incentive to the retirees to act as mentors and pass their skills to the next generation.

One query that would help Hewlett-Packard executives further would be to include salaries from the 'salary' table. This could be compared to what the starting salary would be for that position and help prepare budget forecasts for board members. The analyses could also be repeated at the department level. Grouping by department would give the department managers an idea of how their specific departmet would be affected by the 'silver tsunami' as opposed to a broad company-wide overview.
